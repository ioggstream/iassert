iassert
==========

iassert is a simple testing library supporting:
 *  setup and teardown methods
 *  multiple testsuites
 *  simple error reporting
 
The basic idea of iassert is to execute teardown methods in case of assertion failure using signal handlers.

This non-hortodox approach (signal handlers should use only async-signal-safe functions) 
make this library very easy and efficient in pointing to errors.

Moreover, as failures are triggered by a SIGABRT, the program is in every case doomed to die.
